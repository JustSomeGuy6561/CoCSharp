NOTE: Anything in the UI Folder, especially the Controller Data folder, is very sensitive to editing. The GUI layer uses this data to determine what to do. Do Not edit these
unless you're willing to fix whatever you break in GUI as well. The short answer is don't touch these, the longer answer is don't touch these unless it's a major content change
that requires GUI to parse new data in a unique way. For example, the prison data requires its own special means of displaying, so creating a specific content related class
with prison data makes sense. However, it also required manually implementing HOW it was displayed in EACH GUI, so do so at your own risk. 

Honestly, the GUI is not designed to be flexible - buttons can only have 12 characters, for example, and there's only space for 15 of them on one page. Realistically,
the current number of player stats is the most the game can support in current UI layout, forcing things like the prison system to require a unique layout.
