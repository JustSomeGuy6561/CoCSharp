Quick note: In theory, we should only store information in the backend if it's truly integral to the backend items and how they are handled internally. I can't say that's completely the case everywhere, but it's still something to strive for. As such, the various wearable perks (slutty seduction, wizard's endurance, bulge armor) are not stored in the backend - what happens when we want something that previously only applied to armor also apply to lower garments? do we move it to wearables? and so on. Generally, updating these values means a lot of refactoring code, and we really should refactor the backend as little as possible. we could create an abstract class that derives armor or whatever and extend it with new values, but then it would only apply to armors - what happens when we want to apply it to other wearables? that's redundant code (which, again, makes maintenance more difficult). There are two different ways to deal with this: give it an interface that retrieves a class storing extra data (which we do with creatures), or create an interface for each different perk and apply them as needed. i chose the second, because we only have a few wearable-related perks and it's really straightforward to implement an interface. with the class method, if we add new variables to the class later, we might forget to update the default values. with interfaces, if you're missing one, it obviously can't affect you. either works, i suppose, but this is what we're going with.

Tl;Dr: to make code easier to maintain, the backend is to remain elegant, which means any perk related bools or whatever must be stored in the instances created in the frontend. it's possible to do this in a myriad of ways, but for perks that are common across several items, we've chosen to implement them as interfaces that can be implemented if a particular wearable supports that perk. for perks unique to a single wearable, or more complicated situations, you should roll out your own code and class as needed.

currently we do this for bulge armor, slutty seduction, and wizard's endurance perks, which are
