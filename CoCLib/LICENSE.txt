All code in this project will be marked under GPL-3 License, unless otherwise stated. note that this may potentially use copyrighted and/or trademarked material, which thus requires the following additional terms.
These additional terms only exist under Section 7, Subsection E. If these rights can be determined to not fit under this category, they may be removed as per GPL-3 regulations.

I: ORIGINAL CHARACTERS
Original Characters (henceforth OC or OCs) do not fall under GPL-3, as they are owned by their respective authors. HOWEVER, these authors have agreed to grant Perpetual access to their OCs in "good faith",
legally, this requires that their characters cannot be innaccurately represented, nor can their ownership be misrepresented in any way. if a breach of this occurs, modifications responsible for this breach 
must be reverted. Note that this does not require the reversal of all modifications to the project, just the ones that caused the breach. if such a breach occurs and all parties involved cannot reach agreement,
the author may request the character be removed, and and further works released must respect that. Note that it would be a breach of this contract for this author to release a derivative work that once again
includes their character, as that would violate Section 5 Subsection C. Further, Section 10 does not require this to be retroactively applied to previous versions.

A: Exceptions to Clause I:
	i) Porting Clause: A derived work can include characters who have been removed from this project so long as the original version existed before removal, and the entire work is being converted to a new 
	source format, for archival purposes. note that this must be verbatim to the extent the language allows - all functionality must be kept and no additional functionality can be added. any further works 
	that cause active development past this archival state would require the removal of this character. 

II: OFFICIAL CREDIT:
Contributions to this project are welcome so long as they are licensed under GPL-3. you must mark all modifications, though you may do so anonymously. you may modify the work to include credits to yourself, though
you must do so in a manner that does not overstate your work, in compliance with Section 7 Subsection C. locations have been provided to take credit for creating scenes. you may not modify them, though if you do 
create additional scenes, you may add your own credit there. a document has been provided with this source code listing all authors that have made changes to this work, you may add your name, or request your name 
be removed if it is already there.

Additional Notes:
This project is completely open-source. No author can claim ownership of this project, nor can they limit derivative works. it can, however, be maintained by certain individuals. these individuals have no obligation
to maintain the project, nor modify their works to include changes anyone else has made. these individuals cannot accept modifications that would violate GPL-3 or any of these additional terms.
