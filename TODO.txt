deal with wetness and looseness for vag. no idea if i can just store them in genital - i 
shouldn't because dual vags, but frankly i think implementing that is way more trouble than it's worth
should be there anyway, because it resets when you lose them. 

the same needs to be done for ass, though, again, that gets weird with anemone asshole - do we reset like with vag?
i think that some of that would have to persist, right?

probably should add a function pointer to attack body part interface that defines the attack behavior. alternatively, could move 
all that data to a "special attack" class and require a reference to it. 



GIACOMO, WORMS, and TENTACLE BEAST must be removed from the game. period. full stop. that license is cancer and i ain't having it

replace Giacomo with a "caravan," create tonics for all 4 stats. add a wise old man who teaches the player about dangers and such.
his daughter is a herm and rather pent-up, but because of caravan never really gets any, so has plenty of toys as a result.
may add sexy scene later.

removes worms outright. i'm sure the three people who used them can manage. 

tentacle beast can be removed. corrupted glades are separate of them, and that is where the more interesting stuff is anyway.
could possibly make the glades sentient, and attack/attempt to rape the player if the player leaves, though only part of the time.
