A reaction is basically a mini-scene. It acts just like a regular scene, but instead of being procced through normal user interaction, it occurs as a result of certain conditions. This of course varies based on the type of reaction - an area reaction occurs when the player enters an area and certain conditions are met. A time reaction occurs as a result of time passing, with variations for hourly, daily, and as-needed. There's also a special, one-off time event that occurs on a delay has passed, that immediately removes itself from the time event queue once its done.
