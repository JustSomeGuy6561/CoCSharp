BehavioralSaveable:

Any body part that acts differently based on another behavioral class, but additionally, it is integral to the creature it helps make up - if the data these parts store isn't saved, the creature
is no longer the same as it was the last time the game was played. If this is not the case and other parts can determine this class without saving it, use the BehavioralBase class.

This class is significantly more complex than the base it derives. It now has a surrogate class, and several new functions. Most of these functions deal with describing the class - since the creature
(most specifically the player) depends on it, we need to be able to report changes back to the player, as well as providing information about the current configuration. we now have a string for full description
as well as strings for when it changes or is restored to the default. we also need a default, so that when we create a new creature, we have something to fallback to.

If the body part also has piercings involved, a derived class BehavioralSaveablePiercable has been created to take care of that for you. use that

Implementations: Arms, Face, Back, Wings, Gills etc.

Nearly everything implements this, though a few classes, such as Body and Tongue, use the pierceable variant.
